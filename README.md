# Demo Projects for Serverless Apps on Cloudflare

[Serverless Apps on Cloudflare](https://pragprog.com/titles/apapps/serverless-apps-on-cloudflare/) is a book focussed on how to build applications on [Cloudflare's developer platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/).

The book will teach you how to make use of core Cloudflare developer products including:

- Workers
- Pages
- D1 databases
- Queues
- KV caches
- R2 object storage
- Workers AI
- Durable Objects

Plus all the essential glue that ties them all together. By the end of the book, you'll have all the knowledge required to build applications on Cloudflare's serverless platform.

Each project has a folder in this repository, that you can use as a reference and to sense-check against if you build the projects yourself. For each one, you can pull the code, create any required resources and update `wrangler.toml` and the rest should just work.
